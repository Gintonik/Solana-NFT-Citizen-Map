We need to fetch the governance power of each wallet address in our PostgreSQL `citizens` table, based on their $ISLAND token holdings in the IslandDAO Realms DAO.

üß± CONTEXT (Do not modify the rest of the app):
- DAO URL: https://app.realms.today/dao/IslandDAO
- Governance Token: $ISLAND (Mint: Ds52CDgqdWbTWsua1hgT3AuSSy4FNx2Ezge1br3jQ14a)
- RPC Endpoint: https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=088dfd59-6d2e-4695-a42a-2e0c257c2d00
- Our database contains a list of wallet addresses in the `citizens` table
- We want to show each citizen‚Äôs governance power on the dashboard (read-only)

---

üéØ OBJECTIVE:

Write a script that:
1. Iterates over each wallet address in the `citizens` table
2. Uses the [Realms SDK](https://docs.realms.today/sdk) or direct on-chain queries
3. For each wallet, fetches its current **governance power in IslandDAO** ‚Äî based on the $ISLAND tokens deposited for governance in the Realms program
4. Stores that number in a new `governance_power` field in the citizens table (or in a new table if needed)
5. Can be triggered manually or set as a daily job

üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL GUIDELINES:

- Use `getTokenOwnerRecord` or relevant method from Realms SDK to get voting power per wallet
- DAO programId and RealmId can be derived from https://app.realms.today/dao/IslandDAO or ask via RPC
- You can optionally cache Realm data (RealmId, ProgramId, etc.) once and reuse it
- Don‚Äôt fetch token balances from wallet directly ‚Äî we only care about voting power **actually deposited in governance**, not just holdings

---

üîê SECURITY / RELIABILITY:
- Use the provided Helius RPC endpoint (https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=088dfd59-6d2e-4695-a42a-2e0c257c2d00)
- Handle RPC rate limits, empty responses, and malformed data gracefully
- Use connection pooling for database writes

---

‚úÖ END GOAL:
- For every citizen in the map and profile dashboard, display how much voting power (in $ISLAND) they hold in the IslandDAO DAO on Realms
- Data should be fetched live or updated daily
- Nothing should break the current frontend/map/grid functionality

Let me know once the governance power sync is done so I can connect it to the profile UI.
