Weâ€™ve already built a fully working Citizen Map + NFT Grid app with the following:

- Working PostgreSQL database (nfts, citizens, citizen_nfts)
- Real-time Solana NFT ownership syncing via Helius
- A fully functional frontend with pin placement, NFT grid, profile updates, and social linking
- Leaflet map and Three.js globe (DO NOT MODIFY FUNCTIONALITY)
- Wallet signature verification and admin controls

Your task now is to **modernize the visual design** of the UI **without touching any logic, data, or functionality**.

---

ðŸŽ¯ GOAL: Make the UI look minimal and clean â€” similar to this V0.dev example:
https://v0.dev/chat/minimal-product-card-kbQJhLeP3ox

- Flat colors, clean spacing
- Rounded corners (sm: 8px, lg: 16px)
- Soft shadows (not harsh)
- Use neutral backgrounds (dark gray or off-black)
- Keep padding consistent (e.g. p-3, p-4)

ðŸŽ¨ THEME GUIDELINES: Match IslandDAOâ€™s design language

Use this Figma file for brand direction:
https://www.figma.com/design/X6goiN2s3dtMH4WWBXCHm9/IslandDAO-Logo-Assets?node-id=0-1

Color guidelines (based on brand aesthetic):

- Background: #0F0F0F (deep charcoal)
- Primary Accent: #21E8A3 (IslandDAO green)
- Secondary Accent: #1D1D1D (for cards/panels)
- Text: #FAFAFA for high contrast, #AFAFAF for muted secondary text
- Button hover: slight glow using #21E8A3 with 0.3 opacity

Typography: Use a clean sans-serif font like `Inter`, `Satoshi`, or `Space Grotesk` â€” pick one and apply consistently.

ðŸŽ¯ COMPONENTS TO UPDATE VISUALLY (BUT NOT FUNCTIONALLY):

- Navbar/header (dark, slim, centered or left-aligned)
- Map pin modal or popups (clean cards, shadowed, consistent padding)
- Profile form (aligned inputs, no clutter, light borders)
- NFT Grid (use the style of minimal product cards â€” border, image on top, details below)
- Admin tools (subtle buttons, only visible to verified admin)
- Tooltips / hover states (light glow or accent border â€” no harsh outlines)
- Buttons (flat, rounded, use brand colors for CTA)

---

ðŸ›‘ DO NOT:
- Do not change or remove any backend or database code
- Do not break the map, pin, or wallet interaction logic
- Do not introduce placeholder data
- Do not simulate UI â€” apply actual styles
- Do not restructure working routes or scripts
- Do not override user functionality or login logic

---

âœ… You are ONLY restyling components and views.

Let me know once all components follow a clean, IslandDAO-aligned style so I can test.
